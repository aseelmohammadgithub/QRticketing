My project aims to revolutionize the ticketing process for visiting 
monuments by implementing QR code technology within a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. 
This system will streamline the traditional method of waiting in long queues by allowing visitors to pre-book tickets online 
and receive a unique QR code for entry. The MERN stack provides a robust foundation for developing a responsive web application where users can easily navigate,
purchase tickets, and generate their QR codes. By digitizing the ticketing process, we aim to enhance visitor experiences, reduce waiting times, and optimize monument management 
through efficient data collection and analysis. This innovative solution promises to enhance efficiency and convenience for both visitors and monument staff alike.
